    "# EmptyHeaded + Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "We add basic aggregations to EmptyHeaded following the work of [Puttagunta et al](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07532). The key optimization that we use in EmptyHeaded which other worst-case optimal join processing engines do not use is the ability perform aggregations. We use *generalized hypertree decompositions* (GHDs) as our query plans in EmptyHeaded (thus our our equivalent of relational algebra). This allows us to treat aggregations as tropical semirings that support standard aggregation operations like $\\sum,\\times,\\max,\\min$.  "

    "## Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "The sets of values in the trie can optionally be associated with data values (1-1 mapping) which are used in aggregations. We call these associated values *annotations* following the work of [Green et al.](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1265535). For example, a two level trie annotated with a float value represents a sparse matrix or graph with edge properties. This simple collection of operations over the trie data structure is sufficient to express a wide variety of workloads. "
